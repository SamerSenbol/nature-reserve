Nature Reserve: Part 1
Each item must be made as one or more gitcommits for a new repo. Repot should be added to
github and you should link from github repot to your web address where the page can be seen.


You should do two PHP pages, one index.php and one results.php
From index.php, one form should be able to choose how many monkeys, giraffes, tigers and
coconuts to be found in the nature reserve
The animals should be each class that will inherit from the same superclass (Animal) where makeSound is one
abstract function.
When the form is sent you should come to results.php, and on that page you should see pictures of everyone
animals sent.
example: 2 monkey pictures, 1 giraffe image, 1 tiger image, 10 pictures of coconuts
When you click on an animal they should make a song with Alert, each type of animal should make a kind of leather.
Each individual animal must have a unique name that should be included in the Alert



The nature reserve: part 2
Each item must be made as one or more gitcommits for a new repo. Repot should be added to
github and you should link from github repot to your web address where the page can be seen.
Rename your current index.php to settings.php and make a new index.php, settings.php
should therefore contain the form.
If you have not visited settings.php and sent the form, you should not be able to see results.php
If you visit your new index.php then you should be forwarded to results.php if you already have
sent the form once
If you try to go out to settings.php when you have already sent the form, the page should die
From results.php you should be able to restart your nature reserve with a button
In a form you should be able to choose more animals and plants: lions, antiloops, gorillas, palm trees,
fir trees and roses to be found in the nature reserve.
